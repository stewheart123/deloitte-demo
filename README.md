A simple career guide questionnaire which suggests a potential career path based on the inputs.
I wanted to add some slightly more interesting forms of user input and found a really cool rotary knob for the first slide.

I also built the slider component to accept a wide range of slide types. The idea being that more slides with original ways of inputting data can be interfaced into it - so long as the inputs have a certain input/ output criteria, the matching algorithm will be able to interpret any input into a meaningful result.

This also meant that all the editing happens in one file only - much easier than editing lots of components.
